Some docker images for use in developing Java and Python apps.
It includes needed utilities and libraries.

I will build for the following architectures, and push them on GitHub registry:
- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64/v8

You can use the image by pulling from GitHub registry:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/FatulM/development-images:latest
